The survey was conducted to determine the developers’ professional experience with programming languages, databases, web frameworks among technologies. The data was collected by use of APIs and web scrapping after which it was preprocessed to handle missing, duplicate and other inconsistent data values. It was found that HTML/CSS, JavaScript and Typescript were the most popular programming languages and that PostgreSQL was the most popular database.
It was found that Amazon Web Services (AWS) was the most popular platform among the respondents as was Spring Boot frame work. 41.3% of the respondents were 65 years and older.
The United States of America led in the number of respondents. Majority of the respondents have either a Bachelor’s, masters or an associate degree. Europe, followed by the United states of America topped the respondents who work remotely. The survey revealed a big difference between usage of technology between Europe and North American on one hand the rest of the world on the other. Such a gaping disparity necessitated the need for additional study on the cause of the difference. More study may be necessary to determine if there is difference in technology usage between male and female respondents.
